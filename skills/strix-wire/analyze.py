"""strix-wire analyze — the single scoped, read-only repository analysis.

WIRE-CONSENT-1 (consolidated consent architecture):

  Collapse mechanical permissions, not governance decisions.

This script exists so that the entire read-only analysis phase of
/strix-wire — previously eight to ten separate tool invocations, each
raising its own permission prompt — is ONE command, covered by ONE user
authorization. In a single process it performs, in order:

  1. scope guard          — pin the disclosed analysis root; nothing outside
                            it is ever read (the skill's own bundled files
                            are the only exception, and they are ours). The
                            CLI additionally refuses a --root outside the
                            current working directory unless
                            --allow-external-root is passed explicitly, so
                            the approved command cannot quietly point at an
                            arbitrary directory.
  2. repository check     — is this a code repository at all (stat-only; a
                            non-repository directory is refused before any
                            file content is read).
  3. preflight            — the fail-closed already-governed / production
                            guard (vendored ``preflight.py``, run
                            in-process). A truncated or partially-unreadable
                            scan STOPs instead of passing: "we didn't finish
                            looking" is never reported as "clean".
  4. runtime detection    — Python version, project language markers, and a
                            PATH probe for the toolchain the run step would
                            need. Missing toolchain produces exactly ONE
                            remediation entry, never a retry loop.
  5. scanner              — the consequential-action scanner (vendored
                            ``scanner.py``, run in-process).
  6. candidate analysis   — ranking, temporary-path exclusion (automatic),
                            recommended wrap target, and the coverage map.
  7. helper integrity     — SHA-256 of every bundled helper, compared against
                            any copy already present in the repository.

What this script must NEVER do. Be precise about how that is enforced: there
is NO runtime sandbox here. The guarantee is that the code contains no such
call, and that the test suite fails if one appears — ``test_consent_contract``
scans the source (and the vendored preflight/scanner) for write, subprocess and
network primitives and AST-checks every ``open()`` mode, while
``test_consent_boundary`` and ``test_scope_containment`` assert behaviorally,
via the interpreter's audit hook and before/after tree hashes, that a run reads
only in-scope paths and writes nothing. That is absence-of-capability plus
regression pressure — not a mechanism that would stop a deliberately modified
copy of this file:

  - write, create, delete, move, or chmod any file (its only output is
    stdout/stderr);
  - spawn a subprocess or execute repository code;
  - open a socket or make any network request;
  - read file CONTENT outside the analysis root (bundled skill files and
    the Python runtime's own imports excepted);
  - install anything.

The analysis authorization is single-run and single-root: the emitted
report pins ``consent.scope_root`` and ``consent.expires = "end-of-run"``.
A new run, or a different ``--root``, requires a fresh authorization —
this consent is not a reusable grant, and it never authorizes the two
governance decisions that follow it (source modification; execution).

Exit codes:
    0 — analysis completed read-only (verdict OK or NO_CANDIDATES)
    2 — bad invocation
    3 — preflight STOP (fail closed; analysis halted before scanning)
    4 — remediation required (not a recognized repository / toolchain gap
        that blocks even analysis)
